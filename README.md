# Solve_multivariate_equations
 Solve multivariate linear equation by using genetic algorithm
 
parameters
--help for more information about parameters
-c for coefficient (require)
-p for number of chromosome (require)
-m for Maximun round of genetic algorithm (optional)

The answer show number that was predicted from genetic algorithms and Fitness which is an accuracy of the answer
--------------------------------------------------------
Mean Fitness Graph show how it improve itself in each round to find the answer.
